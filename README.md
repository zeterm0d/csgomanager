# CSGO Manager beta v0.5
## Author: github.com/zeterm0d
Hey! This program may help you to manage your csgo files.
1. It can change the panorama(wallpaper) of your csgo.
2. You can manage your weapons parameters, change and update it. 
3. Lobby is boring for you? No problem, because my program can change each label in the lobby or text in each place in csgo.
